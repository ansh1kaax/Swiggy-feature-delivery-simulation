##  Notes

- Percent-based allocation avoids reliance on fictional numbers while keeping structure real.
- Includes realistic salaries, vendors, and contingency buffer.
- Does **not** include customer support, backend, or legal—those are out of scope for simulation.
- Assumes one sprint cycle (4 weeks) with moderate velocity and fixed scope.
