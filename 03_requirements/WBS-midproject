#  Mid-Project Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

This WBS reflects current development progress across three key features planned and executed during Sprint 1 and Sprint 2.

##  Feature 1: Dark Mode Toggle

1.1 Conduct user research on dark mode preference  
1.2 Decide dark mode logic: manual toggle vs system-based  
1.3 Set default mode to light, with toggle switch for dark  
1.4 Design light and dark themes in Figma  
1.5 Build toggle component and apply global theme logic  
1.6 Save user preference locally (persistent setting)  
1.7 QA: Test all pages for consistent dark mode visuals  
1.8 Check performance on OLED screen mockups  
1.9 Document fallback handling (toggle errors, unresponsiveness)  
1.10 Add dark mode feature notes to release docs

##  Feature 2: ML-Driven Joke Generator (Rule-Based Prototype)

2.1 Define joke tone: witty, sarcastic, pop-culture based  
2.2 Collect joke sources: Bollywood, memes, food puns  
2.3 Map jokes to user segments (e.g. pizza lover, spicy food fan)  
2.4 Create fallback logic for new users (no data available)  
2.5 Build rule-engine logic to rotate jokes per session  
2.6 Design joke display UI (home page placement)  
2.7 Add user control: enable/disable joke toggle  
2.8 Prepare basic privacy note (anonymized behavior tracking only)  
2.9 Visual QA: Check text, emojis, and font styling  
2.10 Draft future plan: replace rule-engine with trained ML model

##  Feature 3: Mini Games (Gamified Engagement)

3.1 Finalize game types:  
  🔸 Hangman  
  🔸 Spin-the-Wheel
