# Acceptance Criteria â€“ Smart Joke Generator Feature - draft v1

## Functionality
- A food-themed joke, quote, or meme appears on the home screen once per day.
- Jokes are humorous, friendly, and culturally relevant (Bollywood, food trends, etc.).
- If user has order/search data, the joke is matched to behavior using simple rule-based logic.
- If no data is available, generic jokes or food-related prompts are shown.

## Personalization and Privacy
- Jokes are never personal or offensive; tone is light, sarcastic, and brand-consistent.
- Data used is anonymized (e.g., cuisine type or order time) and not personally identifying.
- Users can opt out via a toggle switch. Preference is saved and respected across sessions.

## Design and UI
- Jokes may include emojis, short visuals, or reference current pop culture trends.
- Placement is just below hero banner on the home screen.
- Joke is refreshed once per day or after every major session start.

## Machine Learning Integration (Planned)
- Initial version is rule-based.
- Future versions may use an ML model trained on food behavior and preferences.

## Impact
- Aims to reduce bounce rate on home screen and increase user engagement before placing an order.
- Provides a lightweight, entertaining value proposition while retaining the user in-app.

## Limitations
- Does not pull or store PII.
- Works best in regions where Bollywood/cultural memes are well understood.
