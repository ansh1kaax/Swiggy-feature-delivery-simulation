# Project Scope

This project simulates the real-world delivery of user-facing features within the Swiggy ecosystem. The focus is to plan, track, and coordinate cross-functional work for rolling out:

- A manually toggled Dark Mode feature (UI/UX)
- A home-screen Smart Joke Generator powered by rule-based ML logic
- A lightweight Mini Games zone to improve retention

The scope includes:
- Defining feature requirements and user stories
- Planning sprint-level execution and task breakdown
- Creating WBS, success metrics, and a risk mitigation plan
- Using tools like GitHub, Trello, MS Project, Confluence
- Simulating backend–frontend–ML collaboration
- Practicing Agile (Scrum) delivery, DevOps outline (CI/CD), and stakeholder communication

Coding is not part of the project. The deliverables are focused on planning, documentation, and product flow simulation.
