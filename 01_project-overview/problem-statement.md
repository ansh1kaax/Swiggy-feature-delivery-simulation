# Problem Statement

In real-world app development, releasing new features involves coordinated planning between UI, backend, ML, and testing teams. However, most aspiring project managers and product professionals lack hands-on exposure to these cross-functional workflows.

This simulation project addresses that gap by mimicking the feature delivery process at Swiggy. It explores how feature planning, team coordination, DevOps, and Agile practices work together to bring enhancements like dark mode, machine-learning-powered content, and gamified engagement into a real-world food delivery app.
