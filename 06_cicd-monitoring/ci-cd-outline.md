# CI/CD Outline (Updated Final Version)

## Objective
Simulate a basic CI/CD pipeline setup using GitHub Actions â€” to represent how task testing, document deployment, and automation might occur in a live feature rollout scenario.

## Simulated Pipeline Flow

> _Note: This is a simulation only. No code or real pipeline is deployed._

1. Markdown file or doc push to the `main` branch (planned)
2. GitHub Actions would ideally run checks (e.g., markdown linting, broken links)
3. If passed, a simulated Slack alert or Trello label update would occur (described in escalation plan)
4. For ML joke model â†’ a mock API response would be tested using JSON or a placeholder logic (planned for Sprint 3)

### Visualization (For Understanding Only)

âœ… Docs assumed valid â†’
ðŸ“© Slack alert simulated via workflow docs
```

## Tools & Integrations (Planned / Simulated Only)

| Tool         | Role                                       | Status        |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|
| GitHub Actions | Planned for CI automation checks (markdown lint, etc.) | Simulated |
| Trello         | Used for sprint task tracking              | Used          |
| Slack          | Simulated escalation/alert integration     | Simulated     |
| YAML           | Placeholder for CI/CD config (not implemented) | Not used  |

## Clarification Note
> This project is documentation-based. CI/CD elements are conceptual and not technically executed. No YAML workflow, webhook, or code validation pipeline is active. If scaled to production, this pipeline can be enabled using GitHub workflows and CI integrations.
